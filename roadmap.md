### **Phase 2: Agent Implementation & Cognitive Logic (Est. Time: 4-5 days)** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

**Goal:** Build the specialized "neurons" (Myriad Agents) of our system, embedding cognitive logic within them as per [`design and concept.md`](design and concept.md:1). Agents will communicate using established protocols.

*   **Step 2.1: Implement `Lightbulb_Definition_AI` (Type A Fact-Base)** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
    *   **Task 2.1.1:** ‚úÖ Inside `/agents/lightbulb_definition_ai`, created [`app.py`](agents/lightbulb_definition_ai/app.py:1) Flask application
    *   **Task 2.1.2:** ‚úÖ Created [`/query`](agents/lightbulb_definition_ai/app.py:7) endpoint that accepts POST requests
    *   **Task 2.1.3:** ‚úÖ Implemented logic: [`request.json['intent'] == 'define'`](agents/lightbulb_definition_ai/app.py:19) returns hardcoded definition in the standard "Agent-to-Orchestrator (`Agent Result`)" format.
    *   **Task 2.1.4:** ‚úÖ Created [`Dockerfile`](agents/lightbulb_definition_ai/Dockerfile:1) for this agent
    *   **Task 2.1.5:** ‚úÖ Written comprehensive unit tests in [`test_app.py`](agents/lightbulb_definition_ai/test_app.py:1) using `pytest` - all 4 tests pass

    *   **Task 2.2.2:** ‚úÖ Created [`/query`](agents/lightbulb_function_ai/app.py:13) endpoint that accepts POST requests
    *   **Task 2.2.3:** ‚úÖ **CRITICAL TASK:** Implemented the cognitive logic:
        - [`'explain_limitation'`](agents/lightbulb_function_ai/app.py:23) intent returns reasoned limitation: "it generates significant waste heat, making it inefficient."
        - Additional function intents: [`'turn_on'`](agents/lightbulb_function_ai/app.py:31), [`'turn_off'`](agents/lightbulb_function_ai/app.py:39), [`'dim'`](agents/lightbulb_function_ai/app.py:47), [`'status'`](agents/lightbulb_function_ai/app.py:73)
        - Internal state management for simulated lightbulb (on/off, brightness level)
    *   **Task 2.2.4:** ‚úÖ Created [`Dockerfile`](agents/lightbulb_function_ai/Dockerfile:1) for this agent
    *   **Task 2.2.5:** ‚úÖ Written comprehensive unit tests in [`test_app.py`](agents/lightbulb_function_ai/test_app.py:1) with 16 test cases covering all intents and error scenarios

*   **Step 2.3: Network Test** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
    *   **Task 2.3.1:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** Run `docker-compose up --build`.
    *   **Task 2.3.2:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** From your local machine (outside of Docker), use a tool like `curl` or Postman to manually send requests to `localhost:5001` and `localhost:5002` to confirm both agents are online and responding correctly.

**Phase 2 Deliverable:** ‚úÖ **DELIVERED** - Two independent, containerized microservice agents, each responding correctly to their specialized intent via the `Orchestrator-to-Agent (`Agent Job`)` and `Agent-to-Orchestrator (`Agent Result`)` protocols. We have proven that the cognitive logic resides within the specialist agent and network communication is functional.
**üöÄ READY FOR PHASE 3:** Agent implementation is complete and network tested. The system is ready for the development of processing and orchestration layers.

### **Phase 3: Building the Central Nervous System (Est. Time: 4-5 days)**

This phase focuses on fully implementing and integrating their respective communication protocols from [`PROTOCOLS.md`](PROTOCOLS.md:1).

*   **Step 3.1: Input Processor (The "Sensory Cortex")**
    *   **Task 3.1.1:** Implement Parser to extract keywords/entities from user query.
    *   **Task 3.1.2:** Implement Intent Recognizer to determine user's goal.
    *   **Task 3.1.3:** Implement basic Ambiguity Resolver.

    *   **Task 3.2.2:** Implement Formatter for natural language output (and other formats as needed).
    *   **Task 3.2.3:** Output Processor consumes the "Orchestrator-to-OutputProcessor (`Collected Results`)" message from the Orchestrator and synthesizes the final output, as per [`PROTOCOLS.md`](PROTOCOLS.md:1).

*   **Step 3.3: Lifecycle Manager (The "Neurogenesis Engine")**
    *   **Task 3.3.1:** Implement logic to receive "Orchestrator-to-LifecycleManager (`Agent Creation Request`)" protocol.
