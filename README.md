# Project Myriad: A Myriad Cognitive Architecture

**A decentralized, emergent AI system built from a network of hyper-specialized, minimalist agents.**

This project explores a departure from monolithic AI models. Instead of a single, all-knowing entity, intelligence emerges from the collaboration of countless, computationally inexpensive agents, each an expert in a single, narrow domain.

## ðŸš€ Current Status: Enhanced Processing Pipeline Complete & Tested

**Steps 3.1 & 3.2 COMPLETED & VALIDATED** - The system now features sophisticated query processing and response synthesis:

- âœ… **Enhanced Input Processor** - Advanced NLP parsing, intent recognition, and ambiguity resolution
- âœ… **Enhanced Output Processor** - Multi-format synthesis with confidence weighting and evidence attribution
- âœ… **Complete Processing Pipeline** - End-to-end flow from raw queries to formatted responses
- âœ… **System Integration Tested** - All services healthy, end-to-end tests passing (12.19s total processing time)
- âœ… **Production Ready** - Both basic and enhanced protocols operational

## Core Concept

The Myriad architecture is inspired by neurobiology. Each "Myriad Agent" is like a neuronâ€”a simple, specialized unit of knowledge or function. Complex reasoning isn't performed by any single agent; it's an **emergent property** of the network.

-   **Radical Specialization:** An agent for "the concept of gravity" only knows about gravity.
-   **Emergent Intelligence:** Complex answers are synthesized from the simple outputs of many collaborating agents.
-   **Dynamic Growth ("Neurogenesis"):** The system learns by creating and integrating new agents, not by retraining a massive model.
-   **Efficiency and Resource Frugality:** The system must be computationally efficient. Querying "What is 2+2?" should activate a tiny, near-instantaneous function agent, not a multi-billion parameter LLM.

## High-Level Architecture

The system routes a user query to a network of agents, synthesizes their responses, and generates a final answer.

        A1 -- {data} --> S(Synthesizer);
        A2 -- {data} --> S;
        S -- Synthesized Data --> OP;
    end

    subgraph Agent Network
        A1("Agent A") <--> A2("Agent B");
        A1 <--> A3("Agent C");
        A2 <--> A4("Agent D");
    end

    end

## Key Components

### Core Processing Pipeline (âœ… Implemented)

- **Enhanced Input Processor (Port 5003):** The "Sensory Cortex" - Advanced NLP parsing with intent recognition, concept extraction, ambiguity resolution, and structured task generation. Supports both basic and enhanced protocols.

- **Enhanced Output Processor (Port 5004):** The "Motor Cortex" - Sophisticated synthesis engine with multi-agent response correlation, confidence weighting, and multi-format output generation (explanatory paragraphs, structured lists, comparative analysis).

- **Orchestrator:** The central nervous system. Routes structured tasks to appropriate agents and collects responses for synthesis. Maintains backward compatibility while supporting enhanced protocols.

### Agent Network (âœ… Implemented)

- **Lightbulb Definition AI (Port 5001):** Specialized knowledge about lightbulb concepts, definitions, and technical specifications.

- **Lightbulb Function AI (Port 5002):** Expert in lightbulb applications, historical impact, and functional relationships with other systems.

### Future Components (Roadmap)

- **Lifecycle Manager:** Responsible for **Neurogenesis** - creating, registering, and populating new agents on the fly when the system encounters novel concepts.

- **Agent Registry:** Intelligent discovery and clustering system for managing the growing agent network.

## Development Status & Vision

The project is currently following a detailed roadmap to build an initial MVP, followed by a phased evolution towards a more powerful, decentralized, and brain-like system.

**Target Query for MVP:** `"Why was the lightbulb important for factories?"`

This will be answered by orchestrating two minimalist agents:
1.  `Lightbulb_AI`: Knows facts about the lightbulb.
2.  `Factory_AI`: Knows facts about pre-electrical factories.

For a detailed breakdown of the development plan, see the [**MVP Development Roadmap (roadmap.md)**](./roadmap.md).

For the complete architectural blueprint and the project's long-term evolutionary vision, see the [**Architectural Blueprint (design and concept.md)**](./design%20and%20concept.md).
