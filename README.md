# Project Myriad: A Myriad Cognitive Architecture

**A decentralized, emergent AI system built using a brain-inspired, graph-based knowledge network.**

This project explores a departure from monolithic AI models. Instead of a single, all-knowing entity, intelligence emerges from the collaboration of countless, computationally inexpensive agents whose relationships and knowledge are stored and managed in a central knowledge graph.

## System Overview

This repository contains a decentralized, graph-based cognitive architecture implementing:
1) dynamic agent creation for unknown concepts (neurogenesis),
2) intelligent agent discovery and routing,
3) adaptive connectivity via Hebbian learning, and
4) performance optimizations suitable for production use.

### Neurogenesis (Phase 2)
- Dynamic agent creation for previously unknown concepts
- Multi‑agent research before instantiation
- Template-based agent generation (four templates)
- Lifecycle management (creation, monitoring, cleanup) and Docker orchestration
- Graph registration for immediate discoverability

### Enhanced Graph Intelligence
- Multi‑criteria relevance scoring (expertise, capability, domain, performance, availability)
- Context‑aware discovery (query complexity, domain indicators)
- Dynamic agent clustering and background maintenance
- Performance tracking and cache management; orchestrator integration

### Performance Optimization
- Redis-backed caching with compression and TTL policy
- Neo4j connection pooling; optimized timeouts
- Response compression and async processing for non‑critical paths
- Performance monitoring and alerting; error resilience

### Additional Capabilities
- Graph database core (Neo4j) with a dedicated manager service
- Agent‑to‑agent communication (collaboration endpoints)
- Enhanced input/output processing pipeline
- Graph‑based orchestrator with intelligent discovery

This project emphasizes modularity, measurability, and reproducibility, targeting a robust baseline suitable for research and production deployment.

## Core Concept: Biomimetic Intelligence

The Myriad architecture is inspired by neurobiology, implementing **the first true biomimetic neurogenesis** in artificial intelligence.

-   Neurogenesis: the system dynamically creates specialized agents when encountering unknown domains.
-   Specialization: each agent is a minimalist, domain‑specific microservice.
-   Emergent behavior: complex outputs arise from collaboration among specialized agents.
-   Direct collaboration: agents can communicate without orchestrator mediation where appropriate.
-   Graph‑based memory: knowledge and relationships are stored in Neo4j.
-   Resource efficiency: only necessary components are activated per query.

Difference: Unlike static systems, Myriad grows and adapts capabilities by creating new specialized agents as it encounters unknown concepts.
