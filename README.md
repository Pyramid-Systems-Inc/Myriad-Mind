## Core Concept: True Biomimetic Intelligence

The Myriad architecture is inspired by neurobiology, implementing **the first true biomimetic neurogenesis** in artificial intelligence.

-   **🧬 Biomimetic Neurogenesis:** Like biological brains, the system **dynamically creates new specialized neural regions** (agents) when encountering unknown domains. This is true neuroplasticity in AI.
-   **⚡ Radical Specialization:** Each agent is a minimalist, hyper-specialized microservice representing a specific neural function or knowledge domain.
-   **🧠 Emergent Intelligence:** Complex cognition emerges from the collaboration of simple, specialized agents - exactly like biological neural networks.
-   **🔗 Reflex Arcs:** Direct agent-to-agent communication creates fast, specialized pathways that bypass central coordination.
-   **📊 Graph-Based Memory:** All knowledge and relationships are stored in a Neo4j knowledge graph that serves as the system's "connectome."
-   **⚡ Resource Efficiency:** The system activates only necessary components for each query, avoiding the computational waste of monolithic models.

**Revolutionary Difference**: Unlike static AI systems, Myriad **literally grows and adapts** its capabilities, creating new specialized agents as it encounters unknown concepts - true brain-like development.
