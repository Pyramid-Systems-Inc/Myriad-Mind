## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### Production Infrastructure

Myriad includes comprehensive monitoring and observability infrastructure for production deployments:

#### Accessing Monitoring Tools

- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090 - Metrics collection and queries
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3000 - Visualization dashboards (admin/myriad_admin)
- **Redis Metrics**: http://localhost:9121/metrics - Redis performance metrics
- **Service Metrics**: http://localhost:5000/metrics - Orchestrator Prometheus metrics

#### Available Dashboards

1. **System Overview** - Query rates, success rates, active agents, neurogenesis activity
2. **Service Health** - Individual service metrics and health status
3. **Resource Usage** - CPU, memory, network utilization per service
4. **Performance Tracking** - Response times, throughput, error rates

#### Key Metrics Tracked

- **Query Processing**: Total queries, success/failure rates, processing duration
- **Agent Activity**: Active agents count, neurogenesis events, agent discovery success
- **System Resources**: CPU usage, memory consumption, network I/O
- **Service Health**: Uptime, health check status, dependency connectivity

### Backup & Recovery

**Manual Backup:**
```bash
# Create backup of Neo4j knowledge graph
./scripts/backup_neo4j.sh

# Backup location: ./backups/neo4j/myriad_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz
```

**Automated Backup (Cron):**
```bash
# Daily backup at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /path/to/myriad/scripts/backup_neo4j.sh >> /var/log/myriad-backup.log 2>&1
```

**Restore from Backup:**
```bash
# Stop Neo4j service
docker-compose stop neo4j

# Restore backup
docker exec neo4j neo4j-admin database restore \
  --from-path=/backups/myriad_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS \
  neo4j

# Restart service
docker-compose start neo4j
```

### Resource Management

All services have configured resource limits for production stability:

| Service | CPU Limit | Memory Limit | Health Check |
|---------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Neo4j | 2.0 CPUs | 2GB | ✅ HTTP |
| Redis | 0.5 CPUs | 256MB | ✅ Ping |
| Orchestrator | 1.0 CPUs | 512MB | ✅ HTTP |
| GraphDB Manager | 1.0 CPUs | 512MB | ✅ HTTP |
| Other Services | 0.5 CPUs | 256MB | ✅ HTTP |
| Prometheus | 0.5 CPUs | 512MB | N/A |
| Grafana | 0.5 CPUs | 256MB | N/A |

**View Real-Time Resource Usage:**
```bash
docker stats
```

### Database Schema Setup

The Myriad knowledge graph uses Neo4j with a well-defined schema including constraints and indexes for data integrity and performance.

#### Initialize Schema (First Time Setup)

```bash
# Run schema initialization script
python scripts/initialize_graph_schema.py
```

This creates:
- **Unique constraints** on Agent, Concept, and Region names
- **Performance indexes** on frequently queried properties
- **Full-text search** index for concept discovery
- **Default knowledge regions** (General, Science, Technology, Mathematics)
- **Schema version tracking** for future migrations

#### Verify Schema

Check schema status in Neo4j Browser (http://localhost:7474):

```cypher
# View schema version
MATCH (v:SchemaVersion) RETURN v;

# List all constraints
SHOW CONSTRAINTS;

# List all indexes
SHOW INDEXES;
```
