# Orchestrator Microservice Implementation

## Overview

This document details the successful extraction of the Orchestrator from an embedded library into a standalone, scalable microservice as part of **Finding 1** from the architecture review.

## Implementation Status: âœ… COMPLETE

The orchestrator has been successfully converted from an embedded library within the Integration Tester service into an independent, production-ready microservice.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Standalone Flask Application

**File:** [`src/myriad/services/orchestrator/app.py`](../src/myriad/services/orchestrator/app.py)

A complete Flask application with the following endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/health` | GET | Health check for monitoring and load balancers |
| `/process` | POST | Main query processing (supports single query or task batch) |
| `/agents` | GET | List all available agents from the knowledge graph |
| `/metrics` | GET | Performance metrics and feature status |
| `/discover` | POST | Discover appropriate agent for concept/intent pair |
| `/status` | GET | Service status with dependency health checks |

**Key Features:**

- Supports both single query format (`{"query": "...", "user_id": "..."}`)
- Supports batch task format (`{"tasks": [...]}`) for compatibility with Integration Tester
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Integration with all core systems (GraphDB, Performance Engine, Learning Engine, etc.)

### 2. Docker Containerization

**File:** [`src/myriad/services/orchestrator/Dockerfile`](../src/myriad/services/orchestrator/Dockerfile)

Production-ready Docker image with:

- Python 3.9 slim base
- Curl installed for health checks
- Optimized layer caching
- Health check configuration (30s interval, 10s timeout, 3 retries)
- Proper PYTHONPATH configuration

### 3. Service Dependencies

**File:** [`src/myriad/services/orchestrator/requirements.txt`](../src/myriad/services/orchestrator/requirements.txt)

Minimal, focused dependencies:

- `flask==2.3.0` - Web framework
- `requests==2.31.0` - HTTP client for service communication
- `redis==4.5.0` - Redis client for caching
- `werkzeug==2.3.0` - WSGI utilities

### 4. Docker Compose Integration

**File:** [`docker-compose.yml`](../docker-compose.yml)

Added orchestrator service with:

- **Port:** 5000 (exposed to host)
- **Container Name:** `myriad-orchestrator`
- **Environment Variables:**
  - Neo4j connection details
  - Redis configuration
  - Service URLs (GraphDB Manager, Input/Output Processors)
  - Feature flags (Dynamic Agents, Autonomous Learning)
  - HTTP connection pool settings
- **Dependencies:** neo4j, redis, graphdb-manager
- **Health Check:** Configured for orchestration with other services
- **Network:** Connected to `myriad-network`

### 5. Integration Tester Update

**File:** [`src/myriad/services/integration_tester/app.py`](../src/myriad/services/integration_tester/app.py)

Modified to act as HTTP client instead of embedded library:

- Removed local orchestrator imports
- Added `ORCHESTRATOR_URL` environment variable
- Updated `/run_orchestration` endpoint to forward requests to orchestrator service
- Improved error handling for service communication
- Added proper timeout handling (60s for complex queries)

### 6. Orchestrator Library Enhancement

**File:** [`src/myriad/services/orchestrator/orchestrator.py`](../src/myriad/services/orchestrator/orchestrator.py)

Updated to support service mode:

- Made `GRAPHDB_MANAGER_URL` configurable via environment variable
- Maintained backward compatibility for library usage
- Kept all neurogenesis, learning, and intelligence features intact

### 7. Comprehensive Test Suite

**File:** [`tests/test_orchestrator_service.py`](../tests/test_orchestrator_service.py)

Complete integration test suite covering:

- Health check endpoint
- Status endpoint with dependency checks
- Simple query processing
- Batch task processing
- Agent listing
- Metrics retrieval
- Agent discovery
- Error handling

Tests can be run individually or as a complete suite with detailed output.

### 8. Documentation Updates

Updated documentation across multiple files:

**README.md:**

- Added orchestrator service to quick start verification
- Updated basic usage examples to show orchestrator endpoints
- Added orchestrator to microservices table (Port 5000)

**doc/ARCHITECTURE.md:**

- Updated orchestrator section to reflect microservice status
- Documented all REST API endpoints
- Clarified scalability and deployment characteristics

---

## Architecture Changes

### Before: Embedded Library

```
Integration Tester (Port 5009)
  â””â”€â”€ Embedded orchestrator.py
      â””â”€â”€ Calls agents directly
```

**Issues:**

- Single point of failure
- Not independently scalable
- Tight coupling with Integration Tester
- No monitoring or health checks
- Limited reusability

### After: Standalone Microservice

```
Integration Tester (Port 5009)
  â””â”€â”€ HTTP Client
      â””â”€â”€ Calls Orchestrator Service (Port 5000)
          â””â”€â”€ REST API
              â”œâ”€â”€ /health
              â”œâ”€â”€ /process
              â”œâ”€â”€ /agents
              â”œâ”€â”€ /metrics
              â”œâ”€â”€ /discover
              â””â”€â”€ /status
```

**Benefits:**

- Independent deployment and scaling
- Proper health monitoring
- Service discovery support
- Load balancer compatible
- Horizontally scalable
- Clear API contract
- Better separation of concerns

## Troubleshooting

### Service Won't Start

```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs orchestrator

# Common issues:
# - Neo4j not ready: Wait for neo4j health check
# - Port conflict: Change port in docker-compose.yml
# - Environment variables missing: Check docker-compose.yml
```

### Health Check Fails

```bash
# Check if service is running
docker ps | grep orchestrator

# Check service status
curl http://localhost:5000/status

# Restart service
docker-compose restart orchestrator
```

### Integration Tester Can't Connect

```bash
# Verify orchestrator URL in integration tester
docker-compose exec integration_tester_ai env | grep ORCHESTRATOR

# Should show: ORCHESTRATOR_URL=http://orchestrator:5000

# Test connectivity from integration tester
docker-compose exec integration_tester_ai curl http://orchestrator:5000/health
```
