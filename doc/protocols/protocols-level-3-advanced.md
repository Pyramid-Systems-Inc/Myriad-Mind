## Phase 5: Genesis & Multi-Modal Learning

*Implements foundational sensory agents and few-shot learning capabilities*

### 5.1 The Genesis Protocol: Defining the "Primal Core"

This protocol doesn't define a network message but rather the initial state of the system at "birth." The system is pre-loaded with a **Genesis Agent Set**, which are immutable, foundational agents providing the tools for all future learning.

#### 5.1.1 Primal Sensory Cortex Agents (Foundation Models)

**Image_Embedding_AI**: A service wrapping a model like CLIP.

- **Endpoint:** `POST /embed/image`
- **Input:** An image file.
- **Output:** `{ "embedding": [0.123, -0.456, ...], "model": "CLIP-ViT-B-32" }`

**Audio_Embedding_AI**: A service wrapping a model like VGGish.

- **Endpoint:** `POST /embed/audio`
- **Input:** An audio file (e.g., WAV).
- **Output:** `{ "embedding": [0.789, 0.112, ...], "model": "VGGish" }`

**Text_Embedding_AI**: A service wrapping a Sentence Transformer model.

- **Endpoint:** `POST /embed/text`
- **Input:** `{ "text": "A sentence to embed." }`
- **Output:** `{ "embedding": [0.555, -0.222, ...], "model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" }`

#### 5.1.2 Primal Logic & Management Agents

These include the `Orchestrator`, `LifecycleManager`, `Consolidator`, and `Arithmetic_AI`. Their functions are considered "instinctual" and are part of the core, non-learned architecture.

### 5.2 Neurogenesis 2.0 Protocol (Few-Shot, Multi-Modal Learning)

This protocol defines how a new **Concept Cluster** is created from a few examples.

#### 5.2.1 Trigger Protocol: Orchestrator ‚Üí LifecycleManager

**Purpose:** To signal a knowledge gap and initiate the creation of a new concept cluster.
**Endpoint:** `POST /lifecycle/create_concept`
**Payload:**

```json
{
  "concept_name": "dog",
  "triggering_query": "What is a dog?"
}
```

#### 5.2.2 Long-Term Memory Protocol: The "Concept Genome" File

**Purpose:** Defines the structure of a learned concept cluster stored permanently on disk. The `LifecycleManager` writes this file; the `Orchestrator` reads it.
**Location:** A shared volume, e.g., `/memory/long_term/{concept_name}.json`
**Format:**

```json
{
  "concept_name": "dog",
  "cluster_id": "concept_cluster_dog_1678886400",
  "created_at": "2024-03-15T12:00:00Z",
  "textual_knowledge": {
    "definition": "The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf...",
    "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog"
  },
  "visual_knowledge": {
    "prototype_embedding": [0.123, -0.456, ...],
    "embedding_model": "CLIP-ViT-B-32",
    "source_images": ["dog1.jpg", "dog2.jpg", "dog3.jpg"]
  },
  "auditory_knowledge": {
    "prototype_embedding": [0.789, 0.112, ...],
    "embedding_model": "VGGish",
    "source_sounds": ["bark1.wav", "bark2.wav"]
  },
  "related_concepts": {
    "wolf": {"relationship": "ancestor", "strength": 0.9},
    "pet": {"relationship": "instance_of", "strength": 0.8}
  }
}
```

### 5.3 The Tiered Memory Protocol

This defines the communication with the different layers of the system's memory.

#### 5.3.1 Short-Term Memory (Implicit Protocol)

**Location:** Internal state of the `Orchestrator` during a single query execution.
**Function:** Holds all temporary data for a single "thought." It is ephemeral and requires no external protocol.

#### 5.3.2 Medium-Term Memory (MTM) Protocol (Redis-based)

**Purpose:** To track recent interactions for fast retrieval and consolidation analysis.
**Service:** `MediumTerm_Memory_AI` (a wrapper around a Redis instance).

    "agents_used": ["Lightbulb_Definition_AI", "Factory_History_AI"],
    "query_hash": "a1b2c3d4e5f6"
  }
  ```

- **Action:** The MTM service increments access counters and updates timestamps for the given concepts in Redis (e.g., `INCR concept:lightbulb:count`, `SET concept:lightbulb:last_access 1678886400`). Entries have a TTL (e.g., 24 hours) to enable "forgetting."

**Protocol 2: Consolidator ‚Üí MTM (`Get Hot Concepts`)**

- **Endpoint:** `GET /mtm/hot_concepts?threshold=10`

      {"concept": "web3", "access_count": 25}
    ]
  }
  ```

#### 5.3.3 Memory Consolidation Protocol ("Sleep")

**Purpose:** To move important concepts from MTM to permanent LTM (Long-Term Memory).
**Protocol: Consolidator ‚Üí LifecycleManager (`Trigger Consolidation`)**

- **Endpoint:** `POST /lifecycle/consolidate`
- **Payload:**

  ```json
  {
    "concept_name": "nft",
    "reason": "Accessed 52 times in the last 24 hours."
  }
  ```

- **Action:** Triggers the full Neurogenesis 2.0 workflow for the specified concept.

### 5.4 The Conceptual Bootstrapping Protocol ("Curriculum")

This defines the data format for the system's initial, guided learning phase.

**Purpose:** To provide a structured "curriculum" to teach the system its foundational concepts.
**Location:** A directory in the project, e.g., `/curriculum/level_1/`.
**Format:** A manifest file, e.g., `_manifest.json`, that points to learning materials.

```json
{
  "curriculum_level": 1,
  "description": "Core Physical World Primitives",
  "concepts": [
    {
      "name": "ball",
      "text_definition": "A spherical object used in games.",
      "image_urls": [
        "https://example.com/images/red_ball.jpg",
        "https://example.com/images/soccer_ball.jpg"
      ],
      "sound_files": [
        "/curriculum/level_1/sounds/ball_bounce.wav"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "box",
      "text_definition": "A container typically having four sides, a bottom, and a lid.",
      "image_urls": [
        "https://example.com/images/cardboard_box.jpg"
      ],
      "sound_files": []
    }
  ]
}
```

**Action:** A `bootstrap.py` script reads this manifest, gathers the data, and feeds it to the `LifecycleManager` to create the initial set of concept clusters.
