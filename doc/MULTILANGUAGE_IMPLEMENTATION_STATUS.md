## 🚀 Getting Started with Current Implementation

### Testing Language Detection

```python
from myriad.core.multilang.language_detector import get_language_detector

detector = get_language_detector()

# Test English
result = detector.detect_language("What is the impact of the lightbulb?")
print(f"Language: {result.detected_language.value}, Confidence: {result.confidence}")

# Test Spanish
result = detector.detect_language("¿Qué es el impacto de la bombilla?")
print(f"Language: {result.detected_language.value}, Confidence: {result.confidence}")
```

### Testing Multi-Language Parser

```python
from myriad.core.multilang.multilang_parser import get_multilang_parser

parser = get_multilang_parser()

# Parse English query
metadata, parsed = parser.parse_multilang_query(
    "What is the historical impact of the lightbulb?"
)
print(f"Language: {metadata.detected_language.value}")
print(f"Intent: {parsed.primary_intent}")
print(f"Concepts: {parsed.concepts}")

# Parse Spanish query
metadata, parsed = parser.parse_multilang_query(
    "¿Cuál es el impacto histórico de la bombilla?"
)
print(f"Language: {metadata.detected_language.value}")
print(f"Intent: {parsed.primary_intent}")
print(f"Concepts: {parsed.concepts}")
```

### Testing Uncertainty & Socratic Dialogue

```python
from myriad.core.uncertainty.uncertainty_signals import get_uncertainty_detector
from myriad.core.socratic.socratic_questioning import get_socratic_dialogue_manager

# Assess uncertainty
detector = get_uncertainty_detector()
assessment = detector.assess_uncertainty({
    'query': 'What is X?',
    'concepts': ['X'],
    'confidence': 0.3,
    'ambiguity': True
}, 'TestAgent')

# Generate clarification questions
dialogue_mgr = get_socratic_dialogue_manager()
session = dialogue_mgr.initiate_dialogue(
    "What is X?",
    assessment,
    language='en'
)

for question in session.questions_asked:
    print(question.question_text)
```
