# Getting Started with Myriad Cognitive Architecture

**A comprehensive guide to setting up and using the Myriad Cognitive Architecture**

---

## 🎯 Overview

The Myriad Cognitive Architecture is a revolutionary AI system that implements biomimetic neurogenesis - the ability to dynamically create specialized agents for unknown concepts. This guide will help you get started with the system, from installation to advanced usage.

### What Makes Myriad Special?

- **🧬 Dynamic Agent Creation**: Automatically creates specialized agents when encountering new concepts
- **🧠 Smart Discovery**: Intelligently selects the best agents for each query
- **⚡ High Performance**: Optimized for production use with caching and monitoring
- **🔗 Distributed Intelligence**: Knowledge emerges from agent collaboration

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (required for microservices)
- **Python 3.8+** (for development and testing)
- **4GB+ RAM** (recommended for optimal performance)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd myriad-cognitive-architecture
```

#### 2. Start All Services

```bash
# Build and start all microservices
docker-compose up --build -d

# Check that all services are running
docker-compose ps
```

You should see 6 services running:
- `graphdb_manager_ai` (port 5008)
- `input_processor` (port 5003)
- `output_processor` (port 5004)
- `lightbulb_definition_ai` (port 5001)
- `lightbulb_function_ai` (port 5002)
- `integration_tester_ai` (port 5009)

#### 3. Initialize the Knowledge Graph

```bash
# Set the Python path
export PYTHONPATH=src

# Run the migration script to populate the knowledge graph
python scripts/migration.py
```

#### 4. Verify System Health

```bash
# Check each service health endpoint
curl http://localhost:5008/health  # GraphDB Manager
curl http://localhost:5009/health  # Integration Tester
curl http://localhost:5001/health  # Lightbulb Definition AI
curl http://localhost:5002/health  # Lightbulb Function AI
```

All services should return a healthy status.

## 📚 Basic Usage

### Making Your First Query

The simplest way to interact with Myriad is through the Input Processor:

```python
import requests

# Define your query
query_data = {
    "query": "What is a lightbulb?",
    "user_context": {
        "session_id": "demo_session",
        "preferred_detail_level": "standard"
    }
}

# Send the query to the Input Processor
response = requests.post("http://localhost:5003/process", json=query_data)

# Print the response
print(response.json())
```

### Expected Response Format

```json
{
  "query_id": "q_20240101_001",
  "status": "success",
  "response": "A lightbulb is an electric device that produces light through the heating of a filament until it glows...",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "agents_used": ["Lightbulb_Definition_AI"],
  "processing_time": 2.1
}
```

## 🧬 Understanding Neurogenesis

### What is Neurogenesis?

Neurogenesis is Myriad's revolutionary ability to create new agents when encountering unknown concepts. Here's how it works:

1. **Unknown Concept Detection**: The system identifies concepts without existing agents
2. **Multi-Agent Research**: Existing agents collaborate to research the new concept
3. **Template Selection**: The system selects the best template for the new agent
4. **Dynamic Creation**: A new specialized agent is created and deployed
5. **Graph Integration**: The new agent is registered in the knowledge graph

### Triggering Neurogenesis

Try querying about a concept that doesn't have a dedicated agent:

```python
# Query about an unknown concept
query_data = {
    "query": "What is quantum computing?",
    "user_context": {
        "session_id": "demo_session",
        "preferred_detail_level": "standard"
    }
}

response = requests.post("http://localhost:5003/process", json=query_data)
print(response.json())
```

### Neurogenesis Response

When neurogenesis is triggered, you'll see a special response:

```json
{
  "query_id": "q_20240101_002",
  "status": "neurogenesis_with_agent_creation",
  "response": "I've created a specialized agent for quantum computing. Quantum computing is a revolutionary approach...",
  "neurogenesis_data": {
    "concept": "quantum_computing",
    "new_agent_created": true,
    "new_agent_name": "Quantum_Computing_Knowledge_AI",
    "new_agent_endpoint": "http://quantum_computing_specialist:5000"
  }
}
```

## 🔍 Advanced Querying

### Complex Queries

Myriad excels at handling complex queries that require multiple agents:

```python
# Complex query requiring multiple agents
query_data = {
    "query": "Why was the lightbulb important for factories during the Industrial Revolution?",
    "user_context": {
        "session_id": "demo_session",
        "preferred_detail_level": "detailed"
    }
}

response = requests.post("http://localhost:5003/process", json=query_data)
print(response.json())
```

### Comparative Queries

Ask for comparisons between concepts:

```python
# Comparative query
query_data = {
    "query": "Compare lightbulbs and candles in factory settings",
    "user_context": {
        "session_id": "demo_session",
        "preferred_detail_level": "standard"
    }
}

response = requests.post("http://localhost:5003/process", json=query_data)
print(response.json())
```

### Customizing Response Format

Control the length and style of responses:

```python
# Request a brief response
query_data = {
    "query": "Explain how lightbulbs work",
    "user_context": {
        "session_id": "demo_session",
        "preferred_detail_level": "brief"  # Options: brief, standard, detailed
    }
}

response = requests.post("http://localhost:5003/process", json=query_data)
print(response.json())
```

```

### Adding New Agents

To add a new static agent:

1. Create a new directory in `src/myriad/agents/`
2. Implement the Flask application with required endpoints
3. Create a Dockerfile for containerization
4. Add the agent to `docker-compose.yml`
5. Update the migration script to register the agent

### Required Agent Endpoints

All agents must implement these endpoints:

- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `POST /collaborate` - Agent-to-agent communication
- `POST /query` or `POST /<agent-specific>` - Main query endpoint

Example health endpoint response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "agent": "Lightbulb_Definition_AI",
  "concept": "lightbulb",
  "capabilities": ["concept_definition", "knowledge_storage"],
  "uptime": 1234567890
}
```

# Check performance metrics
curl http://localhost:5009/metrics

# Check agent statistics
curl http://localhost:5008/agents/stats
```

### Performance Optimization

The system automatically optimizes performance through:

- **Redis Caching**: Intelligent query result caching
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database connections
- **Response Compression**: Automatic payload compression
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent agent selection

## 🤝 Agent Collaboration

### Direct Agent Communication

Agents can communicate directly without orchestrator mediation:

```python
# Example: Direct collaboration between agents
collaboration_request = {
    "source_agent": {"name": "Lightbulb_Definition_AI", "type": "FactBase"},
    "collaboration_type": "knowledge_request",
    "target_concept": "factory",
    "specific_request": {
        "knowledge_type": "historical_context",
        "research_depth": "comprehensive"
    }
}

# Send collaboration request
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:5002/collaborate", 
    json=collaboration_request
)
```

### Collaboration Types

- **knowledge_request**: Request for information about a concept
- **context_sharing**: Share contextual information
- **concept_research**: Collaborative research on unknown concepts
- **function_execution**: Request execution of specific functions
