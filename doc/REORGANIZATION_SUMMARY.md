1. Verify no file exceeds 1000 lines
2. Verify all content preserved (no data loss)
3. Test all links (automated link checker)
4. Verify navigation flows work
5. Update root `README.md` to point to `doc/INDEX.md`

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Action

**START HERE**: Begin with Phase 1 - splitting `PROTOCOLS.md` into 4 files as this is the largest file and critical for the reorganization.

See [`REORGANIZATION_PLAN_V2.md`](REORGANIZATION_PLAN_V2.md) for detailed content mapping and merge strategies.
