## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Async conversion breaks existing code | Medium | High | Comprehensive testing, gradual rollout |
| Memory system complexity | Medium | Medium | Phased implementation, fallbacks |
| Multi-modal embeddings performance | Low | Medium | Caching, batch processing |
| Autonomous loop runaway | Low | High | Rate limiting, kill switches |
| Resource exhaustion despite limits | Medium | High | Monitoring, alerts, auto-scaling |

### Schedule Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Sprints take longer than estimated | High | Medium | Buffer time, prioritize critical features |
| Dependency delays (Sprint N needs Sprint N-1) | Medium | High | Clear milestone definitions, parallel work where possible |
| Integration issues between components | Medium | Medium | Continuous integration testing |

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Phased Rollout

**Phase 1: Development Environment (Weeks 1-12)**

- Local Docker Compose deployment
- Manual testing and validation
- Iterative development

**Phase 2: Staging Environment (Weeks 13-18)**

- Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Automated testing
- Performance benchmarking

**Phase 3: Production Environment (Weeks 19-24)**

- **Proactive learning** with curiosity-driven exploration
- **Multi-sensory understanding** from text, images, and audio
- **Self-improvement** through autonomous cognition and meta-awareness
- **85-90% similarity** to human cognitive architecture

### Final Achievement

Project Myriad will stand as a sophisticated cognitive architecture that:

1. **Thinks** - Processes information through STM/MTM/LTM like human memory
2. **Learns** - Acquires knowledge from multiple modalities autonomously
3. **Adapts** - Improves performance through Hebbian learning and optimization
4. **Converses** - Maintains context across multi-turn interactions
5. **Explores** - Proactively seeks knowledge driven by curiosity
6. **Reflects** - Monitors its own state and formulates improvement goals
