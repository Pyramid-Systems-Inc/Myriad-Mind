## Core Philosophy

The Myriad Cognitive Architecture is a fundamental departure from the paradigm of monolithic, large-scale AI models. It is founded on the principle that true, scalable, and explainable intelligence is not born from a single, all-knowing entity, but emerges from the dynamic collaboration of countless, hyper-specialized, and minimalist agents.

### Guiding Principles

Our guiding principles are inspired by neurobiology:

1. **Radical Specialization (The Neuron)**

   Like a neuron in the brain is specialized for a task, each "Myriad Agent" is the smallest possible unit of knowledge or function. It knows one thing, and it knows it perfectly. An agent for "the concept of gravity" does not know about poetry.

2. **Emergent Intelligence (The Brain)**

   Intelligence is not located in any single agent but is an emergent property of the entire network. A complex answer is synthesized from the simple, factual outputs of many collaborating agents.

3. **Dynamic Growth (Neurogenesis)**

   The system's primary method of learning new concepts is not by retraining a massive model, but by creating, training, and integrating a *new agent* into the network. The brain grows by adding neurons, and so does Myriad.

4. **Efficiency and Resource Frugality**

   The system must be computationally efficient. Querying "What is 2+2?" should activate a tiny, near-instantaneous function agent, not a multi-billion parameter LLM.

5. **Biomimetic Learning**

   Learning occurs through Hebbian principles: "agents that fire together, wire together." Connection weights strengthen with successful collaboration.

## Design Principles

### Agent-Centric Architecture

- **Microservice Independence**: Each agent is a self-contained microservice
- **Minimal Coupling**: Agents communicate through well-defined interfaces
- **Specialized Knowledge**: Each agent embodies a single concept or function
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Complex tasks emerge from agent coordination

### Graph-Based Knowledge

- **Neo4j Foundation**: All knowledge and relationships stored in graph database
- **Relationship-Driven**: Agent discovery via graph traversal, not lookup tables
- **Hebbian Weighting**: Connection strengths evolve based on successful collaboration
- **Dynamic Structure**: Graph grows and adapts with new knowledge

### Biomimetic Principles

- **Neurogenesis**: System creates new agents for unknown concepts
- **Synaptic Plasticity**: Agent relationships strengthen with use
- **Resource Efficiency**: Minimal activation for simple queries
- **Emergent Behavior**: Intelligence emerges from network, not individual components

### Hierarchical Organization

The architecture mimics the hierarchical and specialized structure of a biological brain:

1. **Cognitive Regions**: Broad domains of knowledge (Technology, Science, Arts, etc.)
2. **Regional Agents**: Specialized agents within each domain
3. **Two-Step Discovery**:
   - Region Routing: Identify relevant cognitive region
   - Agent Selection: Find best agent within region

This reduces search space and improves efficiency, similar to the brain activating specific cortical areas.
